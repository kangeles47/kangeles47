## About
Hi, I'm Karen! I am an analytical professional with a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering and 7+ years of experience in developing and applying Python-based, data-driven models to assess and manage risks associated with natural disasters. My expertise spans catastrophe modeling, statistical and geospatial analysis, data analytics, and data visualization, complemented by a strong track record of enhancing model accuracy and experience presenting complex data findings to a variety of stakeholders, including senior leadership. 

This GitHub provides further details on the various data projects I worked on throughout my Ph.D. See below for an overview of the work and links to relevant GitHub repositories and/or publications.

This work is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship (DGE-1313583). Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in the following research materials are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NSF.

## Overview
The overall aim of the research was to demonstrate how the ever-growing open data landscape creates new opportunities to develop more granular and reliable loss assessment workflows. These site-specific, building-specific, and component-level damage and loss assessments then provide a new opportunity to guide stakeholders' decision-making in the design and mitigation of disaster-vulnerable buildings. This research advances the current state-of-practice in loss modeling in that the work is capable of providing assessments of actual constructed buildings without relying on generalizations of building features or site characteristics -- a practice often implemented in traditional loss assessments (e.g., HAZUS, commercial catastrophe modeling).

### Advancing Building Data Models for the Automation of High-fidelity Regional Loss Estimations Using Open Data
This research formalizes (1) a conceptual data model that leverages open data for efficient integration and querying of component- to site-level information across the loss estimation workflow and (2) the implementation of this data model in Python to tractably generate building models within existing open-source loss modeling workflows.

### Advancing the Design of Resilient and Sustainable Buildings: An Integrated Life-Cycle Analysis
In collaboration with structural engineers, architects, and computer scientists, an integrated life-cycle assessment framework was formalized to deepen the capacity for high-fidelity loss assessment of actual constructed buildings under multiple hazards. The resulting workflow is capable of supporting the iterative design process involved in the delivery of resilient and sustainable buildings. The workflow helps guide stakeholder decision-making by revealing which building components drive loss metrics of repair cost, operating energy, and embodied energy.
